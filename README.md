# Spotify Swipe!
There's plenty of songs in the sea ;)

Our application allows users to make playlists on their Spotify account by swiping between song recommendations. Enter the link to your favourite song, and go on a musical adventure! The recommendations adapt based on the songs users have "right swiped" on.

Enter the share url for a song you want to make a playlist with, the playlist name, and the description. The page will whisk you away to allow permissions for the app to access your spotify account. After that you can get listening!

The app plays a song and displays the album cover, with the artist name and song title. Swipe right to add it to your new playlist or swipe left to move on to the next song.
